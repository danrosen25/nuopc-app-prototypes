    - standard_name: sea_surface_temperature
      canonical_units: K
      description: "
        Sea surface temperature is usually abbreviated as 'SST'. It is
        the temperature of sea water near the surface (including the
        part under sea-ice, if any). More specific terms, namely sea_surface_skin_temperature,
        sea_surface_subskin_temperature, and surface_termperature are available for the skin, subskin, and
        interface temperature. respectively. For the temperature of sea water at
        a particular depth or layer, a data variable of sea_water_temperature
        with a vertical coordinate axis should be used.&#x2019;

    - standard_name: air_pressure_at_mean_sea_level
      canonical_units: Pa
      description: "
        Air pressure at sea level is the quantity often abbreviated
        as MSLP or PMSL. Air pressure is the force per
        unit area which would be exerted when the moving gas
        molecules of which the air is composed strike a theoretical
        surface of any orientation. 'Mean sea level' means the time
        mean of sea surface elevation at a given location over
        an arbitrary period sufficient to eliminate the tidal signals.

    - standard_name: integral_wrt_time_of_surface_net_downward_shortwave_flux
      canonical_units: W s m-2
      description: "
        The phrase 'integral_wrt_X_of_Y' means int Y dX. The data variable
        should have an axis for X specifying the limits of
        the integral as bounds. 'wrt' means with respect to. The
        surface called 'surface' means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
        'Downward' indicates a vector component which is positive when directed
        downward (negative upward). Net downward radiation is the difference between
        radiation from above (downwelling) and radiation from below (upwelling). 'Shortwave'
        means shortwave radiation. In accordance with common usage in geophysical
        disciplines, 'flux' implies per unit area, called 'flux density' in
        physics.
