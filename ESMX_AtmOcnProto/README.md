# ESMX_AtmOcnProto

## Primary Artifacts

Files and sub-directories that implement the concept demonstrated by the prototype. These are the primary artifacts to look at and to pattern actual user code after.

- `esmxBuild.yaml`
- `esmxRun.config`
- Lumo
- TaWaS

## Secondary Artifacts

Files and sub-directories that are needed for the integration into the automated testing infrastructure. In some cases these artifacts might be interesting to look at, but caution should be used to not over interpret the implementation details as recommended use patterns.

- `Makefile`
- `buildSubs.sh`
- `cleanSubs.sh`
